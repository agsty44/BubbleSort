# bubble sort

a simple bubble sort algorithm written in python. put your numbers into the variable "list"

compare the first 2 items and swap if the first is higher. repeat throughout the whole list.

if at any point we make a swap, set our flag to true

if our flag is set to false at the end of the code, we have a sorted list and can print it. if it is set to true, we have made a change and need to pass through the list again.
